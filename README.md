# RDFToSMW

**RDFToSMW** is a project that aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for importing **RDF** and **OWL** files into **Semantic Media Wiki** using PHP.

## How to Install

To install RDFToSMW, you will need a PHP working environment that uses **Apache** or a similar web server. **Extract** the contents and **drag and drop** the **RDFToSMW folder** into your hosting directory. The next and final step is to create a **MediaWiki User** named **Import**.

You are now ready to use **RDFToSMW**.

## Usage

To use the app, you will first need to **upload** an **RDF** or **OWL** file using the **upload button**. Then, you will have the option to use the **VIKI extension**, which provides an interactive **graph** for each page that will be created.

If you choose to use the **VIKI extension**, you will then need to provide the link to your **Semantic Media Wiki**, which can either be your home page or any other page on your wiki.

Once the previous steps are completed, click the **upload button**. If everything goes well, you will be prompted with a download pop-up containing a zip file. Inside the zip file, you will find all the **Semantic Media Wiki pages** in **XML** format.

To load a page into **Semantic Media Wiki**, go to your homepage, then click on **Special Pages** and **Import Pages** (under the Tool Category). Upload your page and enter your wiki name in the **Prefix field**, then click the **import file button**.
